# Anthoscope
Anthoscope is an innovative web-based geospatial application that detects and visualizes vegetation phenology and plant flowering events on a global scale, using NASA satellite data (MODIS, Sentinel-2). The goal is to respond to NASA's challenge with a tool that monitors, predicts, and manages plant flowering, while providing educational and practical value.
